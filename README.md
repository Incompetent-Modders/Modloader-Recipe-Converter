# Modloader Recipe Converter

## Features

### **Folder Selection!**
- You can choose a folder for the converter to interact with.


### **Converting Between Loaders!**
- You can choose to convert between Fabric & Forge.
- Recipes converted from Forge to Fabric will have their used tags altered to match the Fabric format (only "forge" tags). They will also have their fluid amounts adjusted to match Fabric's fluid API.
- The same applies for Fabric to Forge. "c" tags will be altered to match the Forge format.
